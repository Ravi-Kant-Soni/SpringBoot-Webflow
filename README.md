# SpringBoot-Webflow

<p>Spring Web Flow builds on Spring MVC and allows implementing flows within a web application. Itâ€™s used for creating sequences of steps that guide users through a process or some business logic.</p>

## Points:
1. There is a clear start and an end point.
2. The user must go through a set of screens in a specific order.
3. The changes are not finalized until the last step.
4. Once complete it shouldn't be possible to repeat a transaction accidentally
